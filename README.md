# Running Blender on Dis.co's Distributed Platform 

With over half a million downloads per month, Blender is one of the most popular, free and open-source 3D creation tools in the market today. In this sample code, we will focus on the integration of Cycles, a ray-trace based production render engine, on the [Dis.co](http://dis.co) and Packet platform. Dis.co is a parallelization platform that provides easy and flexible ways to scale your compute solutions by automatically offloading tasks onto servers on-demands. On the other hand, Packets is a bare-metal server solution for accessing high-performance computers in minutes. By combining the Dis.co and Packet platform, we are exploring the best of parallelization and best of high-performance bare-metal server configurations for maximal throughputs.
